## Introduction
This project analyzes historical data from the European Football Championship to explore different hypotheses, including the impact of the host nation, common traits of winning teams, and socioeconomic impacts of participation.

## Hypotheses
1. **Host Nation Advantage**: Does the host nation have an advantage in the competition?
2. **Common Traits of Winning Nations**: What are the common traits of nations that win the championship?
3. **Patterns Over Time**: What patterns can be observed throughout the history of the championship?
4. **Socioeconomic Impact**: Is there a socioeconomic impact from participating in the Euros?

## Data
The data used in this project was sourced from Kaggle and includes historical statistics of the European Football Championship.

## Methods
To analyze the data and test our hypotheses, we used:
- **Clustering**: To group teams and analyze common traits.
- **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**: To compare means across different groups and test our hypotheses.
